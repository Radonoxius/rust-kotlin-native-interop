# Rust Interop with Kotlin/Native
Rust Interop with Kotlin/Native

This is a simple Rust interop with Kotlin Native.

#Prerequisites
Rust compiler version 1.83(stable)
Kotlin Native compiler 2.1.0
(This is what I used. The versions should not be a problem.)

You may want to edit Cargo.toml version of libc and the file paths in the def files
and the build shell script.

The native library (*.so) should be moved to /usr/lib for the program to run.

Sorry for not using Gradle.
Thank you.
