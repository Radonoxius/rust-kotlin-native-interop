Rust Interop with Kotlin/Native

This is a simple Rust interop with Kotlin Native.

#Prerequisites
Rust compiler version 1.83(stable)

You may want to edit Cargo.toml and the file paths in the def files
and the build script.

The native library (*.so) should be moved to /usr/lib for the program to run.
